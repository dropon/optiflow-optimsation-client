    RepositioningEffortCost:
      description: |-
        Specifies an increased cost per effort if the route's repositioning effort goes above a threshold.
        When two orders are loaded into the same compartment and delivered in the reverse order, we refer to them as a non-last-in-first-out (non-LIFO) pair. Any non-LIFO pair of orders requires repositioning in the vehicle, as the last picked-up order obstructs the first order that needs to be delivered. The effort involved in this repositioning is the minimum effort required for the two orders. The total repositioning effort for the route is the sum of the repositioning efforts for all non-LIFO pairs of orders.

        extraPerEffort: 0.9301444243932576

        * `AVERAGE` - Describes a situation where travel times fluctuate, depending on the departure time. In this scenario, a typical traffic situation for that time of day and day of week will be considered such as the rush-hour on Monday morning or light traffic on Saturday evening. This traffic situation is only supported in Belgium (BE), Switzerland (CH), Czechia (CZ), Germany (DE), Spain (ES), France (FR), United Kingdom (GB), Italy (IT), Liechtenstein (LI), Luxembourg (LU), The Netherlands (NL), Vatican City (VA) and Australia (AU) and for the routing profiles `EUR_VAN`, `EUR_TRUCK_11_99T`, `EUR_TRUCK_40T`, `AUS_LCV_LIGHT_COMMERCIAL`, `AUS_MR_MEDIUM_RIGID` and `AUS_HR_HEAVY_RIGID`. The spherical distance between any two locations should be at most 650 kilometers when using the `AVERAGE` traffic situation. Moreover, the planning horizon for this combination of routing profile and traffic mode should be at most 2 days. The planning horizon is the difference between the maximum of the latest end time and the minimum of the earliest start time of the vehicles using this combination.

            When two orders are loaded into the same compartment and delivered in the same order, we refer to them as a non-last-in-first-out (non-LIFO) pair. Any non-LIFO pair of orders requires repositioning in the vehicle, as the last picked-up order obstructs the first order that needs to be delivered. The effort involved in this repositioning is the minimum effort required for the two orders. The total repositioning effort for the route is the sum of the repositioning efforts for all non-LIFO pairs of orders.
