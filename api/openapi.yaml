    post:
      description: |-
        Starts an asynchronous optimization of the specified plan. Only one operation can be started for a plan at a time. Trying to start another operation before the current operation is finished results in an error. Whether an operation is finished or not can be checked with "getOperationStatus". To get the result after the operation is finished "getPlan" can be used. In the optimized plan, routes ideally include all transports that are specified in the request. Routes have additional information like arrival and departure times, driving times, service times and more.

        If you call startOptimization multiple times consecutively for the same id, the optimization uses the result of the previous optimization as input, so previously planned transports remain planned in the output routes. If this is not what you intend to do, you can create a new plan before another startOptimization call.

        When starting the optimization, the number of transports in the plan is used to calculate the number of transactions, see [here](../../help/faq-help) for more information.

        There may be some transports that shall not be mixed with some other transports on one trip. For instance, it may be prohibited to load certain dangerous goods together on the same trip, such as flammable solids on the one hand and explosive substances on the other hand. A mixed loading prohibition is a pair of two conflicting load categories that prohibits transports with these load categories to be mixed on the same trip. The load category can be specified for every transport. For a vehicle, there is a flag that lets the vehicle ignore this restriction.
